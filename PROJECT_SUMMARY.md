# MacQuiz - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

MacQuiz is a complete full-stack Quiz Application with Role-Based Management Interface (RBMI) designed for educational institutions. It features a modern React frontend and a robust FastAPI backend.

## 📊 What Was Built

### Backend (FastAPI)
A comprehensive RESTful API with the following capabilities:

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (Admin, Teacher, Student)
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Token-based session management

#### User Management
- Create, read, update, delete users
- Three role types: Admin, Teacher, Student
- Bulk user import via Excel/CSV (frontend ready)
- Student-specific fields (ID, department, class year, phone number)
- Activity tracking for teachers and students
- Admin-only user creation (teachers and students cannot create users)

#### Subject Management
- Create and manage academic subjects
- Subject organization by department
- Subject code and description
- Subject-wise quiz and question bank organization

#### Question Bank System
- Reusable question repository organized by subject
- Difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Topic-based organization
- Teacher and admin can add questions
- Filter questions by subject, difficulty, and topic
- Teachers can pull questions from bank into quizzes

#### Quiz Management
- Create quizzes with multiple question types:
  - Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)
  - True/False
  - Short Answer
- Mix manual questions and question bank questions

- **Time-based quiz scheduling:**
  - Set scheduled start time
  - Configure quiz duration (e.g., 30 minutes)
  - Grace period for late starts (e.g., 5 minutes)
  - Auto-lock after grace period expires
- **Custom marking scheme:**
  - Configurable marks for correct answers
  - Negative marking for incorrect answers
  - Flexible scoring system per quiz
- Quiz activation/deactivation
- Teacher-specific quiz management
- Subject-based quiz organization

#### Quiz Attempts & Grading
- **Timing validation:**
  - Students can only start within grace period
  - Auto-submit on time expiry
  - Track time taken for completion
- Start quiz attempts with eligibility checks
- Submit answers with deadline validation
- Automatic grading with custom marking scheme
- Score calculation with positive/negative marking
- Percentage calculation
