- MCQ options (option_a, option_b, option_c, option_d)
- Correct answer and marks
- Linked to quiz (quiz_id → Quizzes)

#### Quiz Attempts Table
- Attempt tracking (student_id → Users, quiz_id → Quizzes)
- Results (score, percentage)
- Timing (started_at, submitted_at)

#### Answers Table
- Student responses (answer_text)
- Evaluation (is_correct, marks_awarded)
- Linked to attempt and question
