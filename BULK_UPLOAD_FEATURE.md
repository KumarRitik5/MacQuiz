## How to Use

### Step 1: Access Bulk Upload
1. Login as **Admin**
2. Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Users** ‚Üí **Add New User**
3. Click the **"Bulk Upload"** button in the blue highlighted section

### Step 2: Download Template (Optional)
- Click **"Download Template"** to get a pre-formatted CSV file
- Template includes sample data and correct column structure
- Use this as a starting point for your user data

### Step 3: Prepare Your CSV File

#### Required Columns:
| Column | Required | Description | Example |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `role` | Yes | User role (student/teacher/admin) | student |
| `first_name` | Yes | First name | John |
| `last_name` | Yes | Last name | Doe |
| `email` | Yes | Email address (must be unique) | john.doe@example.com |
| `password` | Yes | Temporary password | password123 |
| `student_id` | Conditional* | Student/Roll Number (required for students, unique) | CS001 |
| `department` | No | Department name | Computer Science Engg. |
| `class_year` | No | Class/Year for students | 1st Year |

**\*Conditional:** `student_id` is required only when `role` is "student"

#### Supported Values:

**Role:**
- `student` - For student accounts
- `teacher` - For teacher/professor accounts  
- `admin` - For administrator accounts (use sparingly)

**Class/Year:**
- `1st Year`, `2nd Year`, `3rd Year`, `4th Year`

**Department:**
- `Computer Science Engg.`
- `Artificial Intelligence`
- `Mechanical Engineering`
- `Electrical Engineering`
- Or any custom department name

### Step 4: Upload Your File
1. Click **"Click to upload"** or drag-and-drop your CSV file
2. File is instantly validated
3. Review the validation summary

### Step 5: Review Preview & Issues

#### Validation Summary Shows:
- ‚úÖ **Total Rows**: Count of all data rows
- ‚úÖ **Valid**: Rows that will be imported successfully
- ‚ùå **Errors**: Rows with critical issues (won't be imported)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warnings**: Rows with minor issues (will still be imported)

#### Click "Show Data Preview & Issues" to see:
- **Valid Rows Table**: Preview of users that will be created
- **Errors Section**: Detailed list of problems with row numbers
- **Warnings Section**: Non-critical issues that should be reviewed

### Step 6: Fix Errors (If Any)
If errors are detected:
1. Note the row numbers and error messages
2. Open your CSV file in Excel/text editor
3. Fix the indicated issues
4. Save and re-upload the file

Common errors:
- Missing required fields
- Duplicate emails (in file or database)
- Duplicate student IDs
- Invalid email format
- Student ID missing for students
- Invalid role values

### Step 7: Upload
Once validation shows:
- ‚úÖ **0 Errors**
- ‚úÖ **Valid count > 0**
- The **"Upload Users"** button becomes active
- Click to import all valid users

### Step 8: Confirmation
- Progress bar shows upload status
- Success message displays number of users created
- If some rows had warnings, they're logged
- Modal closes automatically on success
- User list refreshes to show new users

## CSV File Format

### Example CSV:
```csv
role,first_name,last_name,email,password,student_id,department,class_year
student,John,Doe,john.doe@example.com,password123,CS001,Computer Science Engg.,1st Year
student,Jane,Smith,jane.smith@example.com,password123,CS002,Computer Science Engg.,2nd Year

teacher,Bob,Williams,bob.williams@example.com,password123,,Physics,
student,Charlie,Brown,charlie.brown@example.com,password123,EE001,Electrical Engineering,3rd Year
```

### Important Notes:
- First row must be headers (exactly as shown above)
- Use commas as separators
- For teachers, leave `student_id` and `class_year` empty
- Ensure no extra spaces in values
- Email addresses must be unique across all users
- Student IDs must be unique across all students

## Validation Rules

### Critical Errors (Prevent Import):
- ‚ùå Missing required fields (role, first_name, last_name, email, password)

### Validation Takes Too Long
**Issue**: File processing seems stuck
- **Solution**: 
  - Check file size (keep under 1MB)
  - Ensure proper CSV format
  - Refresh page and try again

### All Rows Show Errors
**Issue**: Every row has "Missing required fields"
- **Solution**: 
  - Check that first row is headers
  - Verify column names match exactly
  - Ensure no typos in header row

### Can't See Duplicates
**Issue**: Upload fails but no duplicates shown
- **Solution**:
  - Click "Show Data Preview & Issues"
  - Scroll to Errors section
  - Look for duplicate-related messages

### Upload Button Disabled
**Issue**: Button stays gray/disabled
- **Solution**:
  - Check validation summary for errors
  - Must have 0 errors and at least 1 valid row
  - Fix all critical errors in CSV

### Users Not Appearing
**Issue**: Upload successful but users don't show
- **Solution**:
  - Refresh the users list
  - Check user filters (All/Teachers/Students)
  - Log out and log back in

## Examples

### Example 1: Creating 5 Students
```csv

student,Sneha,Gupta,sneha.gupta@college.edu,temp123,EE2024001,Electrical Engineering,1st Year
student,Vikram,Singh,vikram.singh@college.edu,temp123,AI2024001,Artificial Intelligence,1st Year
```

### Example 2: Creating Mixed Users
```csv
role,first_name,last_name,email,password,student_id,department,class_year
teacher,Dr. Sarah,Johnson,sarah.j@college.edu,prof123,,Computer Science Engg.,
teacher,Prof. Michael,Chen,michael.c@college.edu,prof123,,Mathematics,
student,Lisa,Wang,lisa.wang@college.edu,stud123,CS2024010,Computer Science Engg.,2nd Year
student,David,Brown,david.b@college.edu,stud123,CS2024011,Computer Science Engg.,2nd Year
teacher,Dr. Emma,Davis,emma.d@college.edu,prof123,,Physics,
```

### Example 3: Error Examples (Will Fail Validation)
```csv
role,first_name,last_name,email,password,student_id,department,class_year
student,John,,john@example.com,pass123,CS001,CS,1st Year
teacher,Jane,Smith,invalid-email,pass123,,Math,
student,Bob,Jones,bob@example.com,pass123,,CS,1st Year
student,Alice,Brown,alice@example.com,pass123,CS001,CS,1st Year
```

**Errors:**
- Row 2: Missing last_name
- Row 3: Invalid email format, missing student_id
- Row 4: Missing student_id for student
- Row 5: Duplicate student_id (CS001 used twice)
